# Ground Rules

### Our Pledge

  * **Compatibility is Key**: Ensure any changes are compatible across both iOS and Android, if possible.
  * **Discuss Major Changes**: Create an issue for any major changes and enhancements you wish to make. This allows for transparent discussion and community feedback.
  * **Keep It Focused**: Preferably, each pull request should address a single feature or bug.

# Getting Started

### Submitting a Contribution

For something that is bigger than a one or two-line fix:

1.  Create your own fork of the code.
2.  Make your changes in your forked repository.
3.  Ensure you have followed the project's code style.
4.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5.  Send a pull request\!

### Obvious Fixes

Small contributions, such as fixing spelling errors, can be submitted as a pull request without an associated issue. As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking.
